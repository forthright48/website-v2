# Harmonic Number

The $n_{th}$ harmonic is the sum of the reciprocals of the first $n$ natural numbers: $H_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + ... + \frac{1}{n}$.

The associated harmonic series grows without limit, albeit very slowly, roughly approaching the natural logarithm function.

Bertrand's postulate entails that, except for the case $n=1$, the harmonic numbers are never integers.

# Calculation of $H_n$
The $n_{th}$ harmonic number is about as large as the natural logarithm of $n$, $ln(n)$.

# Identities Involving Harmonic Numbers

$$\sum_{k=1}^{n}H_k = (n+1)H_{n+1} - (n+1)$$
