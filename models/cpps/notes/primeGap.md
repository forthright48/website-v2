# Prime Gap
Gaps between primes does not follow any pattern.

Gaps between two primes can be infinite. Since twin primes occur infinitely too, gap of size 1 also occurs infinite times.

For a particular N, there are many prime gaps below it. Let us call the largest prime gap below $N$, Maximal Prime Gap. The table below lists the first occurrence of Maximal Prime Gaps.

| Gap of Length | First Occurrence |
|---------------|-----------------|
|$0$              |$2$                |
|$13$             |$113 > 10^2$       |
|$111$            |$370261 > 10^5$    |
|$131$            |$1357201 > 10^6$   |
|$179$            |$17051707 > 10^7$  |
|$221$            |$122164747 > 10^8$ |
|$287$            |$1294268491 > 10^9$            |
|$581$            |$1346294310749 > 10^{12}$        |
|$1131$           |$1693182318746371  > 10^{15}$    |
|$1475$           |$1425172824437699411 > 10^{18}$  |

# Application
This knowledge is useful when solving the "Next Prime" problem. Combined with a Primality Testing Algorithm, we can accurately calculate the complexity of finding the next prime bigger than N.
