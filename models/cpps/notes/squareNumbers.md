# Square Numbers
In this post, the word "representable" means "representable as sum of two squares".

# Check Perfect Square
A number $X$ is perfect square if $$\lfloor \sqrt{X} \rfloor \times \lfloor \sqrt{X} \rfloor = X$$.

In order to calculate $\sqrt{X}$, it is better to use `sqrtl()` function instead of `sqrt()`. Just to be safe, check using $\sqrt{X} \pm 1$.

## Properties
- They are the only integers which have odd number of divisors.

# Representable Numbers

**Theorem**: Every prime of the form $4k+1$ is representable.

## Algorithm for Finding

## Product of Representable Numbers

**Theorem 1**: The product of $n$ number of representable integers is also representable, in general, in $2^{n-1}$ ways.

**Theorem 2**:
$$(a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2)=(ac+bd)^2 + (ad-bc)^2 =(ac-bd)^2+(ad+bc)^2$$
